/*  
What is the Big O notation for Function sortProductsByPrice of the Question 4. Explain your reason.
Answer: Big O notation for Function sortProductsByPrice is O(n^2) because the function has two nested loops that iterate through the array members. The time complexity of the function is directly proportional to the square of the number of members in the array.
